"VA019"|6|"GRA"|"Gravelly spot"|A spot where the surface layer has more than 35 percent, by volume, rock fragments that are mostly less than 3 inches in diameter in an area that has less than 15 percent rock fragments. Typically 0.5 to 5 acres.|"255525"
"VA019"|6|"MPI"|"Mine or quarry"|An open excavation from which soil and underlying material have been removed and in which bedrock is exposed. Also denotes surface openings to underground mines. Typically 0.5 to 5 acres.|"255526"
"VA019"|6|"ROC"|"Rock outcrop"|An exposure of bedrock at the surface of the earth. Not used where the named soils of the surrounding map unit are shallow overbedrock or where Rock outcrop is a named component of the map unit. Typically 0.5 to 5 acres.|"255527"

"VA019"|6|"STV"|"Very stony spot"|A spot where 0.1 to 3.0 percent of the soil surface is covered by rock fragments that are more than 10 inches in diameter in areas where the surface of the surrounding soil is covered by less than 0.01 percent stones. Typically 0.5 to 5 acres.|"255530"
